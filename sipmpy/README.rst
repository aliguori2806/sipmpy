* Guide

Here there are the Analysis_IV_curves.py and Analysis_WFs.py scripts that contain the classes and methods of the package.

The main_IV_curves.py and main_WFs.py files contain some template scripts that import the sipmpy classes and methods and perform the implemented analyses.

* Analyses

Forward IV curves at different temperatures: evaluation of the quenching resistances, their systematics and temperature dependence

Inverse IV curves at different temperatures: breakdown voltage evaluation through the inverse logarithmic derivative method and analysis of the temperature dependence of breakdown voltage and current

Waveforms: evaluation of the amplitude and charge integrated spectra and their multi-gaussian fit, from which the SiPM gain and several other parameters are returned.
